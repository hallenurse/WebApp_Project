Web Applications Development - Project

This project will be a website for the Missoula PaddleHeads professional baseball team. (This is actually a realistic project as there is a possibility that the PaddleHeads will need a new website in the coming months and I am excited to get some ideas for that project as I work through the course curriculum for Web Applications Development.) While a website for the PaddleHeads would need to have functionality with the team merch store, baseball team’s websites display information regarding the baseball season such as the schedule of games and the roster of players and coaches.

Off of the home screen/ welcome scree, users will be able to select the “Roster” page. On this page, visitors will be able to see the information on the players and coaches. Information displayed will include their name, number, a biography, and the player’s batting average. Only administrators will be able to make changes to this page, such as adding or deleting a player or changing their statistics.

Another page that website visitors will be able to access is the game schedule for the team. This page will display information about the PaddleHeads games for the season including the location of the game, the opponent, and the time and date of each game. Only website admin will be able to add games (in the case of a rainout reschedule or playoff games) or edit/delete games.
